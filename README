mag2tor.py - Convert magnet link to torrent file.

USAGE: ./mag2tor.py <magnet_link1> [<magnet_link2> ...]

mag2tor.py tries to get .torrent file for each magnet link specified on
its commandline and write it into the current directory. For this it
needs working Internet connection and at least one active
seeder/leecher for the magnet/torrent. NOTE: waiting for magnet may
take days or even forever.

This mag2tor script has been inspired by the Magnet2Torrent from
https://github.com/danfolkes/Magnet2Torrent.git.
